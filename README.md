# RCS API Examples

This repositiory contains example code showing how to make use of the APIs available

This is currently focussed on how to make use of our Deactivation API to remove
RCS accounts from our platform. Sample applications are provided in different
languages.

Further information can be found on our [online documentation](https://docs.jibemobile.com/).
